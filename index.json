	"content": "1. Where is the data from All the data has been collected from WG API, stored in a database and processed with R/RStudio.\n2. Are your numbers correct? Is there bias in the numbers? The statistics have been calculated from a data set with very high number of players (600,000+) and battles (in total 6bn+). That is maybe 4 times the data Blitzstars.com has, but there is still sampling bias as there is in Blitzstars\u0026rsquo; numbers. This is evidenced by the overall WR distribution and the share of all wins out of all the battles in the database being above 50%. This is a topic worth of a longer post - stay tuned.\n3. Why did you make the site? Out of pure interest into analysizing Blitz game statistics and to learn data analysis and R.\n4. What is \u0026ldquo;Relative WR\u0026rdquo;? Relative WR the average WR players achieve with the tank compared to their other same tier tanks. If the tank is perfectly balanced, its Relative WR is 0 %. Large positive Relative WR indicates the tank is \u0026ldquo;very good\u0026rdquo; (read \u0026ldquo;OP\u0026rdquo;). Negative Relative WR indicate the tank performce worse than other same tier tanks. Relative WR is the 2nd best measure of tank\u0026rsquo;s performance, IMHO.\n  Relative WR R code   rWR = Relative WR\nstats.data.table[, WR.tier := sum(all.wins)/battles.tier, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats.data.table[, tanks.tier := .N, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats.data.table[ tanks.tier \u0026gt; 1, rWR := WR - (battles.tier*WR.tier - all.wins)/(battles.tier - all.battles)]; The bit cryptic syntax is R\u0026rsquo;s data.table - one of the fastest software packages for data analysis.\n  5. Is BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; Relative WR different from Blitzstars\u0026rsquo; one? Yes. At the moment Blitzstars.com calculate the Relative WR as WR difference to the players\u0026rsquo; average WR over all their tanks. BlitzAnalysiz() considers only the other same tier tanks. Please note that the tank itself is excluded of the average WR in BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; calculations, but included in BlitzStars\u0026rsquo; calculations. This may extra cause bias with hugely popular tanks.\n6. I spotted a mistake or I have a question/request All the feedback on the site is welcome. You can reach out me via email (Jylpah@gmail.com), Discord (Jylpah#4662). I am also active at WoT Blitz EU forums.\n"

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. Only players with more than 30 battles in a tank during the update and at least total 60 in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.
